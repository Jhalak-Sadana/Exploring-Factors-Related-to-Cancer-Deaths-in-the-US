# Exploring-Factors-Related-to-Cancer-Deaths-in-the-US
The goal of this project is to create a model of cancer incidence using the features provided in the dataset, and identify regions of the country that are most prone to cancer. 
I start by analyzing the dataset at the county level in the US and create a 4-level indicator variable for Median Income to compare the incidence rate of these levels. I have conducted a correlation analysis to see which factors are most highly correlated with cancer incidence rate and identify the most important factors that explain as much of the variability as possible.

Our presentation will be aimed at non-statistical business decision-makers. I have included visualizations to present our results in a clear and concise manner.
